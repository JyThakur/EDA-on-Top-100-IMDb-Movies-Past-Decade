# Exploratory_Data_Analysis
We have the data for the 100 top-rated movies from the past decade along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online.Â 
In this project, I will try to find some interesting insights into these movies and their voters, using
1. Python as Programming Language
2. Libraries within Python
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib.pyplot
3. This project performed using Jupyter Notebook.
